<input

    class="attributes are not broken up by default which is the prettier behavior but {'breakable' +
        'mustache tags'} can be broken up" />

<p>
    Text with spaces inbetween should break at the most fitting point and not
    wait for a {"breakable" + "mustache tags"} to be broken up. {"If the mustache tag itself is very long, however" +
        "it should be broken uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup"}
